Hey! I am Jonathan Martinez a web developer.  This is one of my first small projects. The random-quote-machine!!
It is a fairly simple application that revolves around an API call.

I decided to make this application as part of the Freecodecamp.com curriculum.  It was fun and taught me a lot of skills such as: fine-tuning scss, making api calls, and exporting apps from Codepen.com to VScode.

The app.js file houses all of the logic and structure of this project.  In it, an API call is made to a backend server with several quotes in it.  Every time that the "new quote" button is clicked, it generates a new quote and author from the information it recieves from the API.  This also triggers a background color change.

Hope you enjoy this app!
